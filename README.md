## Lab 1
Introduction to Python
### Task 1
If A =5, B = 7 and C = 3, find which number is greatest and which is smallest using IF ELSE conditions. 
### Task 2
Design a calculator which can perform following operations: 
* Take 2 numbers from user. 
* Take choice of operation from user. 
* Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. 
* Display the result. 
## Lab 2
Loops, Function, Tuples, Lists and Dictionary in Python
### Task 1
Write a program of simple calculator program. Follow the steps below, 
* Declare and define a function name Menu which displays a list of choices for user such as addition, subtraction, multiplication etc. It takes the choice from user as an input and return. 
* Define and declare a separate function for each choice. 
* In the main body of the program call respective function depending on user’s choice. 
* Program should not terminate till user chooses last option that is “Quit".
### Task 2
Write a method to calculate Fibonacci Series up to ‘n’ points. 
### Task 3
Write a program to calculate factorial of a number entered by user. 
### Task 4
Make a dictionary in python which should contain following “keys” and their values: “Name” “Reg. No” “Class” “D.O.B” “Gender”
### Home Task 1
Perform all the functions of list mentioned in this lab manual with atleast one example.
### Home Task 2
Write a program that lets the user enter in some English text, then convert the text to Pig-latin.
*To review, Pig-latin takes the first letter of a word, put it at the end, and appends "ay". The only exception is if the first letter is vowel, in which case we keep it as it is and append "hay" to the end. e.g. "hello" -> "ellohay", and "image" -> "imagehay"*
## Lab 3
Classes and Inheritance in Python
### Task 1
Create a class name basic_calc with following attributes and methods; Two integers (values are passed with instance creation) Different methods such as addition, subtraction, division, multiplication Create another class inherited from basic_calc named s_calc which should have the following additional methods; Factorial, x_power_y,log, ln etc class child_class(parent_class): def __init__(self,x):

#it will modify the _init_ function from parent class
#additional methods can be defined

Arrays, Matrices and Vector Programming in Python
### Task 1
Generate two vectors ranges from 0 to 50. One vector contains first 20 odd numbers and the other should contain first 20 even numbers. Find the sum of both vectors. Find the maximum and minimum numbers and their indices from the resultant vector.
### Task 2
Let A = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]] and B = [[5,8,9],[1,3,1],[6,2,4]], find the following: 
* A+B, A-B, A*B, A/B 
* Find the max, min and mean value of A+B and A-B
* Find determinant and transpose of A*B 
* Find trace of A/B
### Task 3
Let A = [ 1 2 3 4 ] and B = [ 1 2 3 4 ] . Find the following and explain the difference: 
* A*B 
* numpy.dot(A,B)
* numpy.matmul(A,B)
### Task 4
Generate array A and B of size 2 x 2, where A should contain all ones and B should contain 
all zeros. Also perform the following: 
* Concatenate both arrays horizontally and find its shape. 
* Concatenate both arrays vertically and find its shape 
* Concatenate both arrays using “np.dstack()” and find its shape.
* Flatten the resultant array of part c (previous step) and find its shape.
